## 📌 Executive Summary & Purpose

The **Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)** entitles each Member of Parliament (MP) to recommend development works up to **₹5 Crore per annum** for community asset creation across India. With hundreds of thousands of sanctioned projects spanning 785 district authorities, statutory audit bodies (MoSPI, CAG, State Finance Departments) face acute challenges:

1. **Information Asymmetry & Scale**: Auditing >190,000 project dockets manually is administratively unfeasible.
2. **Timeline Stagnation**: Administrative delays from MP recommendation to formal district sanction frequently stretch into years without detection.
3. **Econometric Variance**: Wide cost discrepancies across implementing agencies and districts often mask inflated contractor estimates or split-tenders.
4. **Pitfalls of "Blended Severity Scoring"**: Generic single-score heuristics (e.g. weighted arbitrary scores from 0-100) fail in practice—weighting attempts inevitably suppress subtle delays or over-amplify benign high-value infrastructure.

**NIDHI TRACE** solves this by establishing a **statistically validated, multi-signal audit pipeline**. Instead of opaque blended scores, the platform segments the review workload into **five independent, non-interfering triage lists** grounded in robust statistical methods ($\text{Robust } z \ge 3.5$), empowering vigilance officers and financial auditors to prioritize manual scrutiny with total transparency.

## 📊 Core Platform Figures (Validated Dataset Seed)

The system operates over a consolidated, empirical seed of MPLADS works derived from official administrative filings:

| Dimension | Metric / Figure | Context & Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Total Registered Works** | **198,116** | Consolidated administrative records across 785 district nodes |
| **Analyzed Works** | **171,890** (86.8%) | Records processed through multi-signal econometric pipeline |
| **Review Queue (Flagged)** | **23,329** (13.6%) | Works triggering at least one independent statistical triage list |
| **Critical / High Severity Outliers** | **1,137** (4.9% of flagged) | Breaching robust statistical bounds ($\text{Robust } z \ge 3.5$) |
| **Total Analyzed Corpus** | **₹8,501.1 Cr** | Cumulative value of analyzed infrastructure allocations |
| **Flagged Review Exposure** | **₹1,661.7 Cr** (19.6%) | Total rupee value associated with flagged works |
| **High-Severity Exposure** | **₹262.3 Cr** | Capital allocated to severe cost/timeline outliers |
| **Data Quality Exposure** | **₹494.2 Cr** | Capital tied to reporting errors, stale records, or misclassifications |

## 🔬 Audit Methodology: Five Independent Triage Lists

Rather than a single synthetic score, NIDHI TRACE applies **five decoupled statistical and algorithmic triage lists**:

    Queue --> Dossier[Forensic Case Dossier & Human Auditor Review]
```

### 1. Recommendation-to-Sanction Latency (`flag_delay`)
- **Metric**: Elapsed calendar days (`gap_days`) between MP recommendation and district administrative sanction.
- **Formulation**:
  $$\text{Robust } z = \frac{\text{Delay} - \text{Median}(\text{district})}{\text{MAD}(\text{district}) \times 1.4826}$$
- **Threshold**: Triggered when $\text{Robust } z \ge 3.5$ or `gap_days` > 180 days relative to median district processing latency.

### 2. Sanction Amount Outlier (`flag_amount`)
- **Metric**: Sanctioned allocation amount evaluated against category distribution within the specific constituency and state.
- **Formulation**: Robust $z$-score based on median and median absolute deviation (MAD) within `(constituency, work_category)` cohorts.
- **Threshold**: Triggered when $\text{Robust } z \ge 3.5$, flagging unusually expensive projects relative to peer works in the same category.

### 3. MP Spending Pattern Drift (`flag_mp_drift`)
- **Metric**: Evaluates whether an MP is channeling funds into a specific work category at rates that diverge drastically from their established historical expenditure baselines.
- **Sparse Data Guardrail**:
  > **Important**: If an MP has fewer than 5 historical works in the dataset (`mp_baseline_eligible == false`), drift evaluation is **explicitly suppressed** and marked as *"Insufficient historical baseline data (< 5 works)"* to prevent false alarms on sparse data.

### 4. Unsupervised Multivariate Outliers (`flag_isolation_forest`)
- **Metric**: High-dimensional anomaly detection using Scikit-Learn's `IsolationForest`.
- **Feature Space**: Combines normalized sanction amounts, delay gaps, implementing agency concentration ratios, and regional density indicators.
- **Role**: Identifies atypical project configurations that individual one-dimensional filters miss.

### 5. Data Quality & Administrative Inconsistency (`dq_*`)
- **Metric**: Validates reporting integrity across three core integrity rules:
  - `dq_implausible_amount`: Anomalous entries such as negative amounts, sub-₹1,000 community works, or entries exceeding statutory constituency caps.
  - `dq_stale_status`: Works remaining in preliminary states for multiple fiscal cycles without progress reporting.
  - `dq_possible_miscategorization`: Semantic mismatches between text descriptions and designated category codes.

## 🛡️ Governance, Privacy & Human-in-the-Loop Mandate

NIDHI TRACE adheres strictly to government AI ethics principles:

1. **Human-in-the-Loop**: All algorithmic signals represent statistical leads for human review. The system provides an **Auditor Review & Case Notes** workspace to record official justifications rather than autonomously modifying project dockets.
2. **No Blended Hallucinations**: Every flagged item traces to a specific mathematical violation ($z \ge 3.5$, MAD anomaly, or explicit schema discrepancy) rather than an arbitrary opacity score.
3. **No Synthetic Government Action**: The platform does not claim unverified live integrations with CVC, PFMS, or district treasuries; it is an open audit and analytical workbench.
